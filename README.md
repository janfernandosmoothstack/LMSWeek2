# Library Management System Part 2

The objective of this project was to implement a full LMS application in Java with different users and to download a mySQL driver to allow me to create a connection between my application and the database. This would allow me to perform CRUD operations using SQL statements. I used the console for the UI and this allowed the user to interact with the application whether they were a Librarian, Borrower or an Admin user.
